The Scottish Fold has a sweet expression and a luxurious short, dense coat.",
      sidepara: "The Scottish Fold’s ancestry lies with farm cats, and as you may imagine, a Scottish farm cat needed to be a rugged and hardy animal. Although the show example has come a long way since those days, this is still a robust, tough natured cat. They are easily adaptable to most situations, not worried about loud or busy homes but equally at home in a quiet, single person’s abode. They are said to have a sweet disposition and a tiny voice which is used very rarely.",
